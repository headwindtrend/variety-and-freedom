# Variety and Freedom

These sources present a philosophical dialogue exploring why a divine creator permits luck, inequality, and suffering in a world that often feels unjust. The text argues that a perfectly fair, merit-based system would require total determinism, stripping humanity of genuine freedom, creativity, and the ability to choose goodness. Instead of a scripted reality, the world is depicted as a dynamic environment where randomness and human decisions interact to create history and variety. Inequality is framed not as a divine intention, but as a consequence of human systems and concentrated power that people must actively work to dismantle. Ultimately, the presence of hardship serves as a catalyst for courage, empathy, and collective responsibility, making moral actions meaningful. By allowing for tragedy and structural unfairness, the creator provides a space where justice and love are not automatic functions of nature but are achievements built through human effort.
