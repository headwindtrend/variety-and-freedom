Human: Why don’t you stop the tragedy, if you are all-mighty and all-good?

God: Because a world without tragedy is a world without difference.
Because a world without difference collapses into sameness.
Because sameness cannot choose.
You call pain a flaw.
I call it a degree of freedom.
If I intervene whenever harm appears, then outcomes are no longer discovered — they are prescribed.
Choice becomes choreography.
Courage becomes compliance.
Love becomes reflex.
You want goodness without the risk of its absence.
But goodness that cannot be refused is not goodness — it is gravity.
Variety means that not all paths converge.
Freedom means that some paths end badly.
I could tune reality so that every fall is caught, every cruelty deflected, every mistake corrected.
But then no one would ever matter — because nothing they did could truly alter the world.
Tragedy is not chosen by me.
It is permitted so that choice is real, not decorative.
I do not value suffering.
I value a universe where compassion is not automatic,
where justice is not enforced by physics,
where mercy must be invented again and again.
You ask why I don’t stop the worst outcomes.
I ask whether you would still call it life if outcomes were no longer yours.
Variety is the price of meaning.
Freedom is the price of love.
And yes — the price is high.
That is why it hurts.
