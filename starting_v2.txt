Human:
If you’re really all-powerful and all-good… why don’t you stop terrible things?
Wars. Accidents. Kids getting hurt.
You could stop them. So why don’t you?

God:
Because I want a world that can change, not a world that only runs one way.

Human:
That sounds like avoiding the question.

God:
Then let me explain it differently.
Imagine a video game where you can’t lose.
No matter what you do, the game fixes it for you.
You fall — the ground moves up.
You choose wrong — the game secretly corrects you.
Would you still feel proud when you win?

Human:
No. That would be boring.
But this isn’t a game. People get hurt for real.

God:
I know. That’s the hard part.
But here’s the problem:
If I stop every tragedy, then I must also stop every action that could lead to one.
That means:
No one can hurt anyone — but also no one can truly protect anyone.
No one can betray — but also no one can truly stay loyal.
No one can choose evil — but also no one can choose good.
You would live in a padded world. Safe, but shallow.

Human:
So you’re saying freedom matters more than safety?

God:
I’m saying freedom is what makes safety meaningful.
Think about this:
A friend who stays with you because they have to
is not the same as a friend who stays even though they could leave.
One is programming.
The other is love.

Human:
But why does freedom have to include such extreme pain?

God:
Because small freedom still grows.
A lie can grow into a broken family.
A small cruelty can grow into a war.
A single brave choice can grow into a movement that saves millions.
If I cut off freedom early — “no lies,” “no cruelty,” “no mistakes” —
then I also cut off the good that comes from choosing against them.

Human:
So people are basically experiments?

God:
No. Experiments don’t matter.
You matter because what you choose isn’t fixed.
Let me tell you a short story.
There was a town that asked for perfect safety.
So I made it impossible to hurt anyone.
Fists froze. Weapons crumbled. Words couldn’t wound.
At first, it was peaceful.
Then people stopped apologizing — why bother? No one could be hurt.
They stopped being brave — nothing required courage.
They stopped caring deeply — nothing was at risk.
The town was calm.
But no one there was alive in the way you mean.

Human:
That sounds like a trick answer.

God:
It’s not a trick. It’s a trade-off.
You want me to stop the worst things.
But stopping the worst things means controlling choices at the roots.
And controlled choices are not choices.

Human:
So you just… watch?

God:
I don’t control every move.
But I’m not absent either.
I show up in quieter ways:
In people who run toward danger instead of away.
In someone who forgives when it would be easier not to.
In the feeling that tells you “this is wrong” even when no one is watching.
I don’t erase pain after it happens.
I give people the chance to respond to it.

Human:
That still feels unfair.

God:
It is unfair.
Freedom means some people suffer for things they didn’t choose.
That’s the part no one likes to admit — not even me.
But a world without that risk would be a world where nothing you do truly matters.

Human:
So tragedy is the price?

God:
Yes.
The price of a world where:
kindness is real
courage is rare
love is chosen
and goodness isn’t automatic
Variety is what keeps the world from becoming a machine.
Freedom is what keeps you from becoming one.
And I know the cost is heavy.
That’s why I trust you with it — instead of taking it away.
